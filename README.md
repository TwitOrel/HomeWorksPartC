The project represents a public transportation network implemented using a multigraph, where stations are represented as nodes and travel between stations as edges with distances.
Additionally includes different types of stations and different types of transportation vehicles, each with its own characteristics along the graph's routes.
Consequently, to find the optimal route between stations, with an additional requirement to pass through a specific station, an algorithm based on Dijkstra's algorithm with appropriate modifications was required.
